## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Multiple @media screen breakpoints
- Mobile-first workflow
- Imported web-fonts from (https://fonts.google.com)
 

### What I learned

For this challenge, I had to use some new technologies which required me learn new things. Below is a list of the things i learnt. 
I learnt how to:

- Use flexbox and change the order of flex items. 
- Add slightly transparent background color to an image
- Import web fonts into my html and css code

Below are some of the favorite codes I used for this project:

``` CSS code to change the order of flex items
.card {
  flex-direction: row-reverse; 
}
```

```html tag to create the image with transparent background color
    <div class="background">
        <img src="image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>      
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd love to build my ability to use flexbox property. I would love to use more of imported fonts, images and other resource to reduce my website data size and increase page loading speed.
